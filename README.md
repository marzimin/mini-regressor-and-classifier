# mini-regressor-and-classifier
A simple mini project that goes over the basics of linear and logistic regression using sklearn and a Kaggle dataset.


### Overview and Goals

The Ames Housing dataset is a simple, but useful dataset designed for educational purposes in Data Science. You would be able to utilize methods such as EDA and feature engineering, linear regression, logistic regression, regularization techniques, and model evaluation techniques.

The three goals of this mini project are to:

1. Estimate the value of homes from fixed characteristics (features).
2. Estimate the value of changeable (renovatable) property characteristics, that are unexplained from the fixed ones.
3. Identifying the property characteristics that predict an 'abnormal' sale.
